## Key Features

   - Scroll depth (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
   - Section visibility (pricing, testimonials)

2. **Conversion Funnel Tracking**:

## Next Steps

1. **Get Analytics Keys**:
   ```bash
   cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env.local
   ```
   Then add your Google Analytics and Posthog keys.

2. **Test the Setup**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend && npm run dev
   ```

3. **Implement in Your Components**:
   - Replace regular buttons with `TrackedButton`
   - Use `TrackedForm` for lead capture forms
   - Add scroll and visibility tracking to key sections

4. **Monitor Performance**:
   - Check Google Analytics for page views and events
   - Use Posthog for detailed user journeys
   - Set up conversion goals in GA4

## Analytics Dashboard Links

Once configured, you can view your analytics at:
- Google Analytics: [analytics.google.com](https://analytics.google.com)

The analytics system is now ready to track user behavior and optimize your conversion funnel!
